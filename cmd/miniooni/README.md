# miniooni

This directory contains the source code of a simple CLI client that we
use for research as well as for running QA scripts. We designed this tool
to have a CLI similar to MK and OONI Probe v2.x to ease running Jafar
scripts that check whether these tools behave similarly.

See also libminiooni.
