# OONI probe measurement engine

This repository contains OONI probe's [measurement engine](
https://github.com/ooni/spec/tree/master/probe#engine). That is, the
piece of software that implements OONI nettests.

## API

You can [browse ooni/probe-engine's API](
https://godoc.org/github.com/ooni/probe-engine)
online at godoc.org. We currently don't provide any API
stability guarantees.

This repository also allows to build [miniooni](cmd/miniooni), a
small command line client useful to test the functionality in here
without integrating with OONI probe. You can browse [the manual
of this tool](
https://godoc.org/github.com/ooni/probe-engine/cmd/miniooni)
online at godoc.org. We currently don't promise that the
miniooni CLI will be stable over time.

## Integrating ooni/probe-engine

This software uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)
and requires Go v1.13+. We also depend on [Measurement Kit](
https://github.com/measurement-kit/measurement-kit), a C++14 library
implementing many OONI tests.

Note that `export CGO_ENABLED=0` will disable C/C++ extensions and
therefore will prevent Measurement Kit tests from being linked into
the resulting Go binaries. You may want that in some cases, e.g. when
you only want to use OONI tests written in Go.

The Psiphon experiment requires some secrets that you may not have. To
disable building it, use the `nopsiphon` build tag. For example, you
can use `go build -v -tags nopsiphon ./cmd/miniooni` to build a version
of the `miniooni` testing command that does not include Psiphon.

We plan on gradually rewriting all OONI tests in Go, therefore the
dependency on Measurement Kit will eventually be removed.

A future version of this document will provide platform specific
instruction for installing Measurement Kit and building.
